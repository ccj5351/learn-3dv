# What is rasterization?

## Answered by ChatGPT

In computer vision and computer graphics, **rasterization** is the process of converting geometric data (such as 3D models or vector graphics) into pixel-based images displayed on a 2D grid (raster images). It translates vector information, typically represented by vertices, lines, and polygons, into discrete pixel values.

### Key Concepts:

-   **Geometric primitives**: Rasterization typically starts with geometric primitives—usually triangles, lines, or polygons—as input.
-   **Pixel grid mapping**: Primitives are projected onto the screen space and mapped onto a discrete grid of pixels.
-   **Fragment generation**: For each pixel covered by a primitive, rasterization produces fragments, each carrying data such as color, depth (z-buffer values), and texture coordinates.
-   **Interpolation**: Vertex attributes (color, texture coordinates, normals) are interpolated across fragments.
-   **Depth testing (Z-buffering)**: Ensures that the closest primitives are drawn first, preventing occlusion artifacts.
-   **Anti-aliasing**: Techniques used to minimize visual artifacts (jagged edges) due to discrete sampling of continuous data.

### Pipeline Steps:

Rasterization is commonly part of the graphics rendering pipeline and typically includes these main steps:

1.  **Vertex processing**: Transform vertices from 3D object space to 2D screen space.
2.  **Primitive assembly**: Group vertices into primitives (triangles, lines, polygons).
3.  **Rasterization**: Convert primitives into pixel fragments.
4.  **Fragment processing**: Compute final pixel colors by applying shading, textures, and blending.
5.  **Framebuffer operations**: Store final pixels in a framebuffer to form the displayed image.

### Applications:

-   **Real-time graphics**: Core technique in GPU-based rendering for video games, simulations, and interactive graphics.
-   **Rendering pipelines**: Foundational step in graphics APIs like OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan, and Metal.
-   **Computer vision**: Synthetic data generation for training machine learning models or simulating scenes.

### Comparison with Ray Tracing:

-   **Rasterization**:
    
    -   Fast, efficient, GPU-accelerated.
    -   Standard for real-time applications.
    -   Less physically accurate lighting and reflection effects.
-   **Ray Tracing**:
    
    -   Simulates light paths more realistically.
    -   Higher computational cost.
    -   Commonly used in offline rendering or hybrid methods.


In short, rasterization is a critical step in converting mathematical descriptions of shapes into images suitable for visual display, enabling real-time graphics processing efficiently.
